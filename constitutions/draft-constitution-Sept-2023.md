## (1) Name

The name of this club is the "SFU Game Developers Club", often referred to as the **Game Dev Club**. The Game Dev Club is an SFSS Club and so must also follow the SFSS Club Terms of Reference (https://sfss.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SFSS-Club-Terms-of-Reference-November-1-2022-1.pdf).

## (2) Purpose

The Game Dev Club exists for the furtherance of the following objectives:
- Support and cultivate the community of game developers at SFU 
- Provide training in all aspects of game development
- Provide connections and resources to members working on game-related projects

## (3) Membership

Official membership is extended to all students or alumni who have ever joined to the club through the official SFSS Club Portal (https://go.sfss.ca/clubs/134/info).

Attending most events doesn't require official membership status.

## (4) Organization

### (4.1) President

The role of the President is to:
- Make sure the club runs smoothly
- Deal with any unforeseen issues that pop up
- Run executive meetings at least once per month
- Oversee elections at the end of their term

The President must be elected in a formal election, and has a term length of 12 months, typically starting in early May.

The President is strongly discouraged from resigning at the end of a semester, except in the case of extenuating circumstances. In the case that the President does resign, the Vice-President takes their place. In the event that there is no Vice-President, the President may select a replacement themselves or choose to run an election.

If an election fails to elect a new President, then the old President must continue to run the club until they can find a replacement.

The President is also an executive, and must follow all Executive requirements, unless there is a contradiction.

### (4.2) Executive

The role of an Executive is to:
- Work together with other executives to plan & volunteer to help run events
- Regularly attend executive meetings and give feedback

Every semester an executive is given the option to amicably resign for the foreseeable future. An executive that has resigned may still join the executive team again, provided they still satisfy the requirements.

In order to apply to the executive team you must satisfy the following requirements:
- Be an SFU Student
- Have attended at least one in-person or online meeting / event
- Have displayed somewhat active and positive participation in our discord server (we are somewhat lenient with this requirement)

After applying as an executive, you must go through a very brief interview / screening with an existing executive to make sure you're cool.

### (4.3) Old Executive

An old executive is any executive who has resigned from the executive team. They may continue to give advice to the executive team or offer opportunities.

### (4.4) Sub-Categories

The following are sub-categories that any executive may optionally decide to take the responsibilities for. An executive may have as many sub-categories as they wish. Unless otherwise specified, a sub-category can be shared by multiple executives, in which case duties must be broken down & shared. In the case of any disagreements, the President gets to decide how duties are separated.

#### (4.4.1) Vice-President

The role of the Vice-President is to:
- Be envied by other executives 
- Maintain a fancy title
- Become the acting President upon the disappearance or resignation of the current President

Only one executive can be the Vice President.

#### (4.4.2) Moderator

The role of the moderator is to keep track of all online communities that the Game Dev Club runs and maintain a reasonable and respectful conduct by all participants.
